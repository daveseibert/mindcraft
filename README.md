Not the real one. See [kolbytn/mindcraft](https://github.com/kolbytn/mindcraft)

This repo will focus on dockerization and running a server for the bot to join.

- [X] Add server container
- [X] Get secrets from env vars (it was already like this)
- [X] Get host/port from env vars (there was an env var for port, but not host)
- [ ] Add a second model
- [ ] Try to get it to run on Raspberry Pi
